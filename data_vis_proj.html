            <h2>
                The Historical Context
            </h2>
            <p>
                The US Presidential elections are a very important event occurring every four years. Likened to the olympics
                of politics, the outcome of a US presidential election is important for not only the United States but for 
                the entire world. The US is a global superpower, therefore the elected president holds superpowers that can 
                change the course of history forever. Join me on this journey through the last six elections and the factors
                that influenced them.
                <br><br>
                Note: If you are not already aware, many of the following visualisations are coloured red and blue.
                These colours correspond to the colours of the two major political parties in the United States. Blue represents the Democrats. 
                Red represents the Republicans.
                <br><br>
                Below you will find a map of the United States that displays the winning party for each state in each of the last six elections.
                This map is to simply provide some context to how US citizens have voted over the last 20 years.
                <br><br>
                Select a year to get started! Hover over a state to find out a little more about the winning party.

            <p>
                Comparing the maps over each election, it seems that elections are won by securing swing states throughout the 
                middle of America. Key states including Pensylvania, Georgia and Nevada play key roles in delivering a 
                presidential candidate a win in a given election.
                <br><br>
                This map provides the context to explain the factors in the following visualisations.
                <br><br>
            </p>
    
            <h2>
                How do Events Around the World Impact the Elections?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Now we have the context surrounding the US Presidential elections of the last 20 years, we can dive deeper into the factors that may influence the outcome.
                One such factor are events that occur around the world and their impact on the citizens of the United States.
                <br><br>
                Events around the world have significant impacts on society and its psyche at a particular time.
                Needless to say, negative world events, such as terrorist attacks, instill feelings of fear, anxiety and a willingness
                to be protected amidst chaos. Questions surrounding how citizens vote during this time is explored below.
                <br><br>
                Click the button below to see a plot of the most important world events occurring over the last 23 years. 
                The top five categories of health, economical, political, science and technology, as well as conflict are shown.
                <br><br>
                Hover over an event to find out what happened!
            </p>
            <button onclick = 'drawBubble()' id = 'bubble_button'> 
                Show Bubbles!
            </button>
            <br><br><br><br>
        </div>
    
        <svg id = 'bubble_chart' width = '1200' height = '700' ></svg>
    
        <div class="commentary">
            <p>
                In order to answer the above questions, events have been scored by their relevance and positivity.
                <br><br>
                The data is displayed in a grid-like plot where the relevance of the event to the US elections is displayed on the x-axis
                and the positivity score (how good the event was) is shown on the y-axis. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, the most relevant but heinous events are found in the bottom right corner while the most positive events 
                are seen in the top right. 
                <br><br>
                Continue on to see the average positivity score over each election as well as the average scores seen when the 
                Democrat or Republican parties have one the election.
            </p>
        </div>

            <div>
                <button onclick = 'update(scores)' class = 'selected_button' id = 'score_button'>Score Across All Elections</button>
                <button onclick = 'update(mean)' id = 'avgscore_button'>Average Score Over Elections</button>
            </div>
            <svg id = 'bar_charts' width = '1200' height = '700'></svg>


    
        <div class="commentary">
            <p>
                The positivity score here is now a combination of the relevance to the United States and the positivity of the event.
                This has now been averaged for each election year, and then for each party.
                <br><br>
                It is quite clear that when the Republican party has won the election more "bad" things have happened in the years leading 
                up to the election. The tendency to vote Republican in times of world distress is likely due to a range of factors, 
                potentially stemming from fear and distrust in the more progressive Democrat party. 
                <br><br>
                One thing is for certain, it seems the Republican party feeds on the fear of the times. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>Who Turns Out to the Elections?</h2>
    
            <p>
                Another important factor for US Presidential elections is the amount of people and the demographic of those
                who turnout to vote.
                <br><br>
                Unlike in Australia, voting in America is optional. Therefore, the final turnout to an election can significantly
                influence the result.
                <br><br>
                The following plot is a line chart that demonstrates the total turnout rate over the last six elections.
                The datapoints are coloured by the winning party of that election year.
                Select a year to reveal a radial bar chart of the turnout rate of different age groups in that election.
                <br><br>
                You can then change the group at the top of the visualisation to switch the turnout rates to education or
                ethnicity.
            </p>
    
            Group: <select name="" id="selectGroup" onChange = 'updateRadial(this.value)'>
                <option value="Age">Age</option>
                <option value="Education">Education</option>
                <option value="Ethnicity">Ethnicity</option>
                </select>
        </div>
    
        <svg id = 'line_chart' width = '1200' height = '500'></svg>
        <svg id = 'radial_chart' width = '1200' height = '500'></svg>

        <div class="commentary">
            <p>
                Looking at the initial line graph we can see that in general the higher the turnout rate the more likely the 
                Democrat party will win the election. This comes with the exception of the 2012 election in which there was
                a significantly decreased turnout rate for that year.
                <br><br>
                It is difficult to analyse all groups of all elections in this visualisation. However a few of key points are 
                easily seen from the data. Firstly, when younger citizens vote in an election, the Democrat party generally wins. 
                Secondly, when a larger proportion of less educated white people vote, the election swings toward the Republican party.
                Lastly, Hispanic and Non-hispanic black people tend to vote more Democratic.
                <br><br>

            <h2>Does More Money Mean More Votes?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Perhaps the most important factor in elections, money can be the difference between a successful or
                unsuccessful campaign. 
                <br><br>
                The tornado chart below demonstrates the total spending over the last six elections seperated by each party.
                The winning party is outlined in a gold stroke.

            <button onclick = 'drawButterfly()' id = 'but_button'>

            <svg id = 'butterfly_chart' width = '1200' height = '700'></svg>
    
        <div class="commentary">
            <p>
               Well its true what they say, "money talks". Five out of the last six elections have been won by the party that 
               spent the most money. And the amount of spending has rapidly increased in the last 20 years! 
                <br><br>
                Looks like if you want to win an election you may want to invest in a little fundraising. 
            </p>
    
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
            <p>
                I hope you had as much fun on this visual journey as I did creating it. Of course, the elections are not exclusively
                decided on the factors described on this page. In reality, the outcome of an election is probably a complex 
                amalgamation of many factors, all combining together to deliver a candidate presidency. Feel free to move back
                through the page to play with any of the visualisations. Try not to break them :).
